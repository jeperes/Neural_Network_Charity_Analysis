# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this project is use neural network to help a nonprofit organization to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which ones are high risk, designing and training models using Python Tensorflow library.

# Resources
- Python
- Jupyter notebook/Google Colab
- Tensorflow Library

# Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

The variable we are targeting in this module is the IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

All the columns are considered features for the model.

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

The features 'EIN' & 'NAME' were droped because wasn't to necessary.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

The first hidden layer has 80 neurons, the second layer has 30.

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

I did not reach the target of 75%.

## Summary: 

The models accuracy was just 46%. Even that I did not reach the percentage expected, it is possible to reach 75% accurace.
